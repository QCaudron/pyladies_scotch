# PyLadies Lightning Talk
### 7 March, 2016
### Vancouver, BC

This is a lightning talk for the PyLadies meeting in Vancouver. It's a very quick intro / demo to the [scotch](http://scotch.readthedocs.org) package, starting with a non-technical introduction on stochastic ( and especially Markovian ) processes.
